Abstraction-
Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. 
It’s used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.


Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. 
You don’t need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. 
The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.

dbms job is to provide abstract view of data
